# BAX-422-API-Application
An API application course project

Used APIs:
* Amadeus - https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service
* OpenWhether - https://openweathermap.org/api

### Proposal:
Problems/Questions Solved:
* What is the current weather at my destination?
  * (Use OpenWeather API to fetch real-time weather data for a given location.)
* What are the cheapest flights available from my city?
  * (Use Skyscanner API to retrieve flight prices and compare options.)
* What options do I have to rent a car at my destination?
  * (Use Skyscanner Car Hire Live Prices API to check rental car prices.)

### DLC:
Apply web scraping technique on:
* **Wiki page:** The Wiki page provides a comprehensive list of airlines worldwide to extract airline details, such as their codes, countries of operation, and hub airports.

* **Additional webpage:** Scraping real-time hotel reviews from *<u>Booking.com</u>* will allow the system to provide more detailed hotel recommendations, incorporating actual user feedback, ratings, and review sentiments.
